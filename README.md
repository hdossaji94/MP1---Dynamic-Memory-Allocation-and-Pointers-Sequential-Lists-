# MP1---Dynamic-Memory-Allocation-and-Pointers-Sequential-Lists-


PLEASE VIEW mp1.pdf FOR FULL INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS!

The goal of this machine problem is to familiarize you with the basics of maintaining information with dynamic memory allocation and pointers. This assignment provides a simple example of data abstraction for organizing information in a sorted list. We will develop a simple abstraction with a few key interfaces and a simple underlying implementation using sequential arrays. In a subsequent programming assignment we will expand upon the interfaces and explore alternative implementations. We will refer to this abstract data type (ADT) as a sequential list.
