# Test script to show a few simple tests for the sequential list ADT.
# 
# TEST 1:  Go through a few scans removes and list without anything in the list to make sure it works#  with no data
# 
No records with >= 1 matches
# 
Did not remove: 4
# 
Did not find: 1
# // The test did not find a record as predicted because nothing has been inserted so nothing could be removed or found
# TEST 2:  Add three entries to list to make sure insert is working correctly
